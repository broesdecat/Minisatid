Solver README:

This is the solver of the IDP system. It generates models for theories in the propositional fragment of FO(.).

To get it working, you need the following software packages:
bison
flex
gcc, version 4.0 or up

Optionally, the solver can be built with support for arbitrary precision integers, allowing large optimization problems.
For this, the GMP (GNU Multi Precision library) has to be installed on your system. To built, replace
CFLAGS    = -I$(MTL) ...
with
CFLAGS    = -D GMP -I$(MTL) ...
in the makefile.
