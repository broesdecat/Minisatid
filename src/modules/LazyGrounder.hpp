 * How does it work:

 * have a vector with "grounded" clauses and an index of where we are in the full clause
 * make the grounded clauses 1-watched
 *
 * during propagate:
 * 		if a clause becomes fully false, extends its grounding until it can become true, set that as watch
 * 		if it cannot be made true any more, backtrack to the appropriate level and add the full clause to the solver
