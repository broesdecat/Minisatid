Using lcov:

build with CXX flags "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage"

only works for SAME source and build dir SB (as ABSOLUTE path)

run
	lcov -b SB -d SB --zerocounters

run the program with the tests you want to check code coverage for

run
	lcov -b SB -d SB -c -o app.info

generate html output
	genhtml app.info
	
Current PROBLEM: due to some problem with how to program is built, the FLEX and BISON grammar files have to be present
at the root of SB to be found correctly.
