This is the readme for the MinisatID solver, the search algorithm used in the IDP system.

*** Installing and running the system
Required software packages:
   - C and C++ compiler, supporting most of the C++11 standard. Examples are GCC 4.4 or higher, clang 3.2 or visual studio 11.
   - Cmake build tools. 
   - Bison and Flex parser generator software.
   - Pdflatex and doxygen for building the documentation.
   - (optional) Gecode for constraint programming support.

Assume minisatid is unpacked in <minisatiddir>, you want to build in <builddir> (cannot be the same as <minisatiddir>) and install in <installdir>. 
Building and installing is then achieved by executing the following commands:
	cd <builddir>
	cmake <minisatiddir> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installdir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release"
	make -j 4
	make check
	make install

Alternatively, cmake-gui can be used as a graphical way to set cmake options.
